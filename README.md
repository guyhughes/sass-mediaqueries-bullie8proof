![Media Queries Mixins for Sass](http://paranoida.github.com/sass-mediaqueries/images/logo.jpg) BullIE8proof

---

### Browser support

__sass-mediaqueries__ (upstream): Only modern browsers that support media queries.

__Bullie8proof__: So I've refactored upstream's mixins with [Jake Archibald's no-IE-left-behind](https://github.com/jakearchibald/sass-ie) brilliance.

## How to install

Download it or use `curl`:

```
curl -O https://raw.github.com/guyhughes/sass-mediaqueries/master/_{media-queries,old-ie}.scss
```

Inside your sass/scss file (ie. `application.scss`) add:

```
@import "media-queries";
@import "old-ie";
```
